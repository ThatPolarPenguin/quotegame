# Gameplay

In order to start to build your ship you, as the player, will need to acquire ten (10) designated ship parts found in the shop which can bought with credtis. Credits will be awarded to the player upon sucessful answering of a quote. Per each correct answer the player will recieve one (1) credit added to their inventory, the total amount of credits one has can be viewed from the shop menu. Now how can you increase the amount of credits from one for a correct answer?

Enter collectibles! The shop will sell a limited supply of collectibles each game. These collectibles are randomized each time the quote game is loaded, this allows for some amazing combinations to be present as well as a unique game experience each time the player restarts. Each one of the collectibles will have an associated name and price, in credits, which is required to purchase the collectible. Upon sucessful purchase of a collectible, it will be housed in the player's inventory and increase the amount of credits a player recieves from a correct anser by one. Once again, there are a limited number of these collecibles within the shop. Once they are gone, there will be no restocking!
