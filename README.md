# Instructions

Welcome to a Star Wars quote game, fully coded in Python!
Hope you are ready to use your vast knowledge about a galaxy far, far away to
achieve the ultimate goal of building your very own personal starship to
explore the reaches of the Star Wars universe!

# Goal of the Game

As mentioned briefly in the introduction, you will need to
build a starship to fulfill your dream of exploring the vastness of space. If
you're asking yourself: how do I build a starship based on answering quotes,
you are probably not alone. Let's explain a few minor game details below.

# Gameplay

To start to build your ship, you as the player will need to
acquire ten designated ship parts found in the shop which can bought with credits.
Credits will be awarded to the player upon successful answering of a quote. Per
each correct answer, the player will receive one credit added to their
inventory, the total amount of credits one has can be viewed from the shop
menu. 

When answering a question, there must be a specific naming convention used when playing the quote game. Please refer to the section titled *Naming Conventions* below.

Now how can you increase the amount of credits from one for a correct
answer? Enter collectibles! The shop will sell a limited supply of
collectibles for each game. These collectibles are randomized each time the
game is loaded allowing for amazing combinations to be present offering a
unique game experience each time the player launches the game. Each one of the
collectibles will have an associated name and price, in credits, which is
required for purchase. Upon successful purchase of a collectible, it will be
housed in the player's inventory and increase the number of credits a player receives
from a correct answer by one. Once again, there are a limited number of these collectibles
within the shop. Once they are gone, there will be no restocking!

Ship parts will also be housed in the shop menu. A player
must purchase all ten of the following ship parts to successfully build their
starship and win the game: *Hyperdrive, Engines, Weapon Systems, Hull,
Deflector Shields, Cockpit, Coaxium, Life Support Systems, Cargo Hold,
Navicomputer.* Within the ship parts purchasing menu there will be the
associated name and price, once again in credits, the player can select from.
Once a part is purchased, it will go into the player's inventory and be removed
from the shop.

The player will continually be asked quotes, reshuffling if necessary, until they purchase the required amount of ship parts or end the game prematurely.

The player will be presented 5 quotes from a vast dictionary
of quotes, one at a time. Each time the player answers a message of
"Correct!" or "Wrong!" will be present depending on the
input given. Credits and their associated multipliers, based on the number of
collectibles, will be added to the player's credit total. Once the 5 questions
have finished, it will automatically return the player to the game menu to make
another selection.

it will most likely be used. A player may answer with the first name of the
character who said the quote, but this is not always guaranteed to be correct.

answer the questions correctly. Please note this is not a complete list of what
